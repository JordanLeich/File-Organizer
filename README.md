# File-Organizer
 The script creates several folders in Downloads and moves files with specific extensions to their corresponding folder.
 Folders that are downloaded are also automatically moved to the 'FOLDERS' folder.
 The script is very easy to addapt to suit your needs, so feel free to tinquer with it.
 
 This is my first project to be posted on github. So please adjust your expectations accordingly :) .
 
## Requirements
 The script only uses standard python modules so there is no need to install aditional modules.
 The script itself requires a Python interpreter to run. I normally run it in my IDE.
 
## How to use
Simply run the Organizer.py file

Alternatively you can run the File Organizer.exe and it will install the required files for you even if you dont have python installed!
 
## Important
 Depending on the size of your (Downloads-) folder it can take quite a while for all the files to move/organize during the first run. Don't terminate the script while it's running because that may corrupt some of your files.
